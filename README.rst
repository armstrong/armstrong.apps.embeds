armstrong.apps.embeds
========================
Provides a way to store, relate to, extract metadata and embed content from
external URLs via a modular backend system. Representing external URLs in a
database model brings the typical benefits of relational data but also allows
more flexible use of the exteral content beyond the one-trick pony of the
standard "<iframe>" copy-paste embed code.
